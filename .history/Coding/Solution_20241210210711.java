For X-Mas, santa claus is preparing a X-Mas Tree with set of Bulbs.
The bulbs are of different voltages, and preparation of tree as follows:
	- The bulbs are arranged in level-wise, levels are numbered from 0,1,2,3..
	  so on.
	- At level-1: There will be only one bulb as root bulb.,
	- From next level onwards, we can attach atmost two bulbs, one is to left side
	  and/or the other is to right side of every bulb in previous level.
	
Entire X-Mas tree has to be prepared with certian rules as follows:
	- For every even level in the X-Mas Tree, all the bulbs should have
	  odd voltages in strictly ascending order.
	- For every odd level in the X-Mas Tree, all the bulbs should have
	  even voltages in strictly descending order.
	
You will be given the X-Mas Tree root,
Your task is to findout whether the X-Mas tree is prepared as per the rules
or not.

Implement the class Solution.
1.public boolean isXmasTree(Node root): returns a boolean value.

NOTE:
    '-1' in the input is to indicate NULL values.


Input Format:
-------------
A single line of space separated integers, voltages of the set of bulbs.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3 8 4 3 5 -1 7 

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 8 4 3 5 7 7 

Sample Output-2:
----------------
false


Sample Input-3:
---------------
1

Sample Output-3:
----------------
true
